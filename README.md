# Deep_Learning
## Some deep learning projects are based on tensorflow
### Project one:face recognize
1. Use OpenCV to read and enter face image data
2. Organize image data into TFrecords, which is more conducive to reading and writing
3. Based on tensorflow high-level packaging and dataset to achieve the recognition process to be closer to real production
4. Using a simple network LeNet, the recognition accuracy is 98%
5. You can learn the basic operations of Estimator from this example.
6. I am too lazy to write a configuration document, some of the file paths that appear in the code can be created and put into the corresponding image.
